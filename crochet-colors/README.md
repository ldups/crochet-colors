# Crochet Colors

This project allows a user to input color combinations and check if they have already been entered. Users can input colors using drop downs, then the color combination will display on the screen, and the user will be alerted if the combination or a permutation of it has already been used. The user can then save the combination. It will be saved locally to the db.json file. All saved combinations are displayed on the screen.

## How to Use

To use, open two command prompt windows. In one, run the command ```npm start```. In the other, run the command ```npm run server```.

## Resources Used
